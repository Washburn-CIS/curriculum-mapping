# Curriculum mapping library

## Alignment of Curriculum to External Standards

This project houses efforts towards development of XML codification of external (or internal) standards, but is still a work in progress. 

## Dependencies (ubuntu packages listed)
* python3
* pytest-benchmark  (python3-pytest-benchmark in Ubuntu 20.04)
* libxml2-utils
* xmllint (this is part of libxml2-utils in the Ubuntu 20.04 repositories, and does not need to be installed separately)

## Status 

Currently in development as a library to assist in mapping learning outcomes between syllabi in CIS at Washburn University and 2023 CS Curricula Recommendations as well as various certification objectives. 

## Prior Work

This work is a fork of the MWSU curriculum library: https://github.com/mwsu-csmp/curriculum
